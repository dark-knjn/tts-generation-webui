@rem This script will install git and conda (if not found on the PATH variable)
@rem  using micromamba (an 8mb static-linked single-file binary, conda replacement).
@rem For users who already have git and conda, this step will be skipped.

@rem This enables a user to install this project without manually installing conda and git.
