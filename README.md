## Upgrading
*In case of issues, feel free to contact the developers*.

### Upgrading from v5 to v6 installer
* Download and run the new installer
* Replace the "tts-generation-webui" directory in the newly installed directory
* Run update_*platform*

#### *Is there any more optimal way to do this?*

Not exactly, the dependencies clash, especially between conda and python (and dependencies are already in a critical state, moving them to conda is ways off). Therefore, while it might be possible to just replace the old installer with the new one and running the update, the problems are unpredictable and **unfixable**. Making an update to installer requires a lot of testing so it's not done lightly.

### Upgrading from v4 to v5 installer
* Download and run the new installer
* Replace the "tts-generation-webui" directory in the newly installed directory
* Run update_*platform*

## Manual installation (not recommended, check installer source for reference)

* Install conda or another virtual environment
* Highly recommended to use Python 3.10
* Install git (`conda install git`)
* Install ffmpeg (`conda install -y -c pytorch ffmpeg`)
* Set up pytorch with CUDA or CPU (https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/build.windows.html#install-pytorch)
* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/rsxdalv/tts-generation-webui.git`
* install the root requirements.txt with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* clone the repos in the ./models/ directory and install requirements under them
* run using `(venv) python server.py`

* Potentially needed to install build tools (without Visual Studio): https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/

## Docker Setup

tts-generation-webui can also be ran inside of a Docker container. To get started, first build the Docker image while in the root directory:

```
docker build -t rsxdalv/tts-generation-webui .
```

Once the image has built it can be started with Docker Compose:

```
docker compose up -d
```

The container will take some time to generate the first output while models are downloaded in the background. The status of this download can be verified by checking the container logs:

```
docker logs tts-generation-webui
```
